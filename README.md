Gridix is a fully customisable grid based storage system.

It takes in the size of your space as well as ideal size for individual grids and even the bed size of your printer.

A website with drag and drop containers for visualising your space allows you to decide what containers to print without wasting filament.

Gridix is designed as a more permanent solution to gridfinity, it's unlikely grids and containers generated with gridix will be compatible to other gridix systems.
